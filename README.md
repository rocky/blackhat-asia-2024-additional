Here, we have material that I had to cut out from my BlackHat Asia 2024 talk.

You can see this HTML rendered [here](https://rocky.github.io/blackhat-asia-2024-additional/).

The basic set of slide in print form is [here](https://rocky.github.io/blackhat-asia-2024-additional/all-notes-print.html)

A video fo the presentation can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA77SFncppE).


Again, I would like to thank the BlackHat Asia program selection committee, the organizers, and my coach Phil Young, for all of the help in making this possible and allowing me a forum to present the work and ideas behind it. I receive very little compensation for the years of work I have spent on this, the recognition is appreciated.
