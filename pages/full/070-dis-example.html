    <p>The first step in Python decomplation getting a disassembly
    listing of the bytecode.</p>

    <p>Running the Python <em>dis</em> module which is part of its
    standard library is the most common way people get a bytecode
    disassembly for Python source. Notice that we are passing the name
    of Python <em>source</em> text file to the <em>dis</em> module.

    <p>Internally, the command-line interface to the <code>dis</code>
    creates bytecode, and disassembles the bytecode it
    created. Although with <code>dis</code> you can't disassemble
    bytecode directly from the command-line, there are
    internal <code>dis</code> library routines that allow you to start
    out with just the bytecode.</p>

    <p>Now let's look at the output [down]</p>

    <p>I will not go into too much detail on this. For more
    detail, look at the additional materials for this talk.<p>

   However, if you are familiar with assembly-language, you'll
   see things that look like labels on the left in white are
   source-code line numbers.  Here, first instruction starts line
   1. The second instruction doesn't have a line number so it too
   belongs to line 1. You'll see there is a blank line after that, so
   that ends the group of instructions that forms line one.

   <p>The numbers in purple are bytecode offsets from the start of the code.</p>

    <p>In blue, we have the bytecode operation like "LOAD_CONST" or
    "STORE_NAME". This bit of information will be useful when we get
    to tokenization.
    </p>

    <p>Next is an optional operand. Internally this is encoded as a
      small number. When there is a parenthesis afterwards, that is
      the decoded operand value.</p> [down]

    <p>In <em>dis</em> output, sometimes there are no parenthesis
      showing a interpreted operand value. Here, you will have to
      know what the encoding is by reading the Python docs on the
      opcode. Or use a better disassembler which I will show in the next slide using <em>xdis</em>.</p>[down]

    <p>Sometimes a bytecode instruction has no operand at all. Later
    when we get to grammar reduction, we will show more information
    about what is happening on here.[down]</p>

    <p>Finally, code groups into sections. The first section is the main program. Part of the reason it is long is that <em>at run time</em> we create functions. [down]</p>
    <p>The code section ofr the function five also appears. It is pretty short.

    <p>Don't get confused between disassembly and decomplation as I
      see happen in various help forums. This slide shows
      disasasembly, which gives some sort of assembly code.  In
      previous slides, we should <em>decompilation></em> which gives
      Python source code.
    <p>

    <p>Disassembly is easy and straight-forward. Decompilation is
    hard. However decompilation it starts out with a diassembly of the bytecode. [next]</p>
