      I come back to this graph of contributors and contributions to
      the project that I showed at the beginning. As you see, there
      hasn't been much activity outside what I have done.

    <p>Oh, and one fun thing you might see in this graph... If you look
      carefully all the way to the right or the most-recent activity,
      you will see a small uptick in both the green and orange. That
      is the uptick from me beefing up the code in prepration for this
      talk! The big blip in 2018 was me getting ready to talk about
      this in conjunction with a debugger I wrote at a 2018 Python
      conference.

    <p>Malware in Python is a thing: it isn’t going to abate.
      This list is from github projects listed under the tag "python-malware".
    </p>
    <p>
      If people are interested in being able to understand Python
      malware in order to thwart it, more people are going to have to
      step up to the plate to either work on code, or support and fund
      others to work on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m not saying that you have to pay me, or that the projects I
      have described here have to be worked on. While the other
      decompilers for Python are generally not as good, more to the
      point, their activity and responsiveness to bug is far below
      than what I can do for the decompilers I work on. Not
      surprisingly, those projects are no better funded than the ones
      I work on.
    </p>
    <p>AI with the right amount of work may help. But that too is
      going to require a lot more work. The results I have seen so far
      aren’t very good. Just as with these decompilers, every year,
      the learning model will need to be updated and the training
      adjusted, due to bytecode and the language change. Language
      drift here is much greater than human language drift.
