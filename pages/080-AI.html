  <h1>Can AI Save the Day?</h1>
  <p>Overal Idea versus Exact Results?</p>
  </ul>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>
      Because of the need and paucity of decompilers, AI has been
      suggested as a possible way to get high-level information from
      machine code.  After all, ChatGPT is pretty good at producing
      convincing essays, and seems pretty good summarizing vast
      disparte tracts of text. Is decompiling a program like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, ChatCPT is not every good or efficient as a
      way to add numbers, balance books, or compute load stresses on
      bridges. AI is notoriously bad at giving plausable, but wrong
      information.
    <p>
      But is decompilation more like human language communication or
      hard computation?
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it a little bit of both. One thing I have discovered in
      decompilation in the way I will describe is that, as with human
      language you might not have to understand everything in order to
      be helpful. If I am translating from French to English, I might
      not need to know the proper gender of nouns, just that they
      exist and in English you can ignore that part. There can be that
      feel in decomplation as well. There may be some extraneous
      instructions in Python bytecode to pop off evaluation stack
      entries in some branch of code. Understanding why the entries
      need to be removed or even the semantics of the stack cleanup
      operations, other than detecting that sometimes you see this
      extraneous stuff.
    </p>

    <p>But on the other hand, in understanding malware there are
    places where you do want exact detail. Not simply that this code
    is decrypting something, but the exact details of how the
    decryption works. Having a system that works 60% of the time
    <em>overall</em> is of no comfort if some specific malware one that
    is crucial to undersand falls outside of that 60%.

    <p>Reconstructiong program control flow in Python bytecode can be
      very tricky. Changing the target of a jump instruction to be
      either the instruction before or after where it would normally
      jump, in other words chaning a single bit in a byte, can wildy
      change the control flow and thus the meaning of the program.
    </p>
    <p>ML programs like Tensorflow and PyTorch use a gradient princple
    that by its nature assumes that the things it reasons about or
    more or less continuous. And in programs can we have they very
    sharp discontinuities as in changing a jump address.
    </p>
    <p>That said, I do think Machine Learning can be used to assist
      decompiling programs. But for it to be more effective I think it
      will need input that is not raw bits and bytes but has been
      first been classified somewhat. I come back to this later after
      understand more about how to think about decompilation. [NEXT]
