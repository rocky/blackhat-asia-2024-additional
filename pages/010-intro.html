      Let me start out with a little survey...
      <div style="color:
		  blue; background-color: LightYellow">[DOWN] #/1 ⟶ #1/0/0</div>
    </p>

    <p>Please raise your hand if use have used Hex-Rays Ida Pro,
    Ghidra, or Binary Ninja? <em>Report count</em> I see a lot of
    hands, Awesome! <div style="color: blue; background-color:
    LightYellow">[DOWN] #1/0/0 ⟶ #1/0/1</div></p>

    <p>How about using any of these to decompile <em>Python</em>
    bytecode to <em>Python</em> source text?</p>

    <p>Hmm... If you have your hand up, after the talk, I’d
      <em>appreciate</em> it you’d let me know how you do
      that!</p>

    <p>As far as I know, there is no support for Python decompilation
      in any of these. In preparation for this
      talk, I spoke to one of the founders from one of these
      reverse-engineering tool makers who confirmed this. More
      generally, he says that <em>all</em> the above kinds of
      decompiler tools, that start from machine code are
      pretty <em>bad</em> when it comes to <em>any</em> interpreter
      that runs off bytecode. <div style="color: blue;
      background-color: LightYellow">[DOWN] #1/0/1 ⟶ #1/0/2</div></p>

    <p>Now please raise your hand if you have
    used <em>uncompyle6</em>, or <em>decompyle3</em>?</p>
    <p><em>Report count</em>. Ok. After this talk, you'll <em>all</em>
    know a bit about these.<div style="color: blue; background-color:

    <p>I’m the current maintainer and developer
      of <em>uncompyle6</em>, and <em>decompyle3</em>.  These are
      Python programs that you can get from PyPI. I’m sorry for my
      really bad choice of project names.
    </p>

    <p>This page shows github commit activity for <em>uncompyle6</em>
      from 2012 to now. 31 people have contributed to this open-source
      project, usually submitting one or two Pull Requests. These
      are <em>greatly</em> appreciated. Keep up the good work! But
      over the vast sea of time, I have been working on this largely
      by myself. My contributions are in bottom left. The person who
      is ranked second in commits, moagstar, is to the right. I
      haven’t heard from him in a little over 7 years.</p>

     <p>Back in 2016, I started this project on github from
      a <em>tar</em> of a <em>copy</em> of an <em>archive</em> from an
      obsolete version-control system. The code had been abandoned for
      about 5 years. And that accounts for the big gap at the left.
    </p>

    <p>In 2018, I gave a talk at Python conference. So you see another
      flurry of activity for 2018 in the middle of the graph.
    </p>

    <p>
      This code works for Python bytecode from the very first version
      in 1999, to Python version 3.8 which is no longer
      current. Python 38 came on the scene a few years ago. But Python
      38 is still supported and it is still in use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since code is old, large, and Python compilers have gotten more
      sophisticated, the code needs better technology to keep up with
      Python. So I forked the code, refactored it and reduced its
      size. That accounts for the drop off in activity you see on the
      right part of the graph from 2021 to now . The forked code goes
      under the name <em>decompyle3</em>. It only handles Python 3.7
      and 3.8.
    </p>

    <p>A fun fact: on the extreme right, you see a little uptick. That
    is me working on the code in preparation for <em>this</em> talk.</p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, even changes to decompyle3 weren’t aggressive
      enough to track changes to Python bytecode and the Python
      language. Therefore, I have an <em>experimental</em> decompiler
      for Python 3.8 to 3.10.  Towards the end, I will show a little
      bit of that. <div style="color: blue; background-color:

      doing open-source work since 2000.</p>

    <p>
      When not doing my day job, I have been writing open-source
      software. But now that I’m retired, I spend even more time on
      this. <div style="color: blue; background-color:

    <p>So the code I've written in <em>general</em> has had plenty of
      time to spread around. If you have have software installed that
      matches any of the logos on the first line, then you have code
      I've written.</p>

    <p>I don't have any cool logos for the software that I’m going to
      be talking about today. But the software used by the projects
      with the logos on the left, use a CD-reading library, called
      "libcdio" that I started in 2000 and maintain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I’m interested in other things like an open-source
      Mathematica, and debuggers. Most of the software, I have written
      is GPL and I am a member of the Free Software Foundation.
