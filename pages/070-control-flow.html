    <p>Let’s now consider this simple Python program to compute the
      number of 1 bits in a positive integer.  If you are interested
      in algorithms, you might find this code interesting. But the
      only thing that concerns us when thinking about the control
      flow, is that it is a program with the following
      characteristics...
    </p>

    <p>Nested inside the main body of code is a <em>while</em> loop
      ... <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		      LightYellow">[DOWN] #/15 ⟶ #15/0/0</div>
    </p>

    <p>
      But nested inside the <em>while</em> loop ... <div style="color:
      blue; background-color: LightYellow">[DOWN] #/15/0/0 ⟶
      #/15/0/1</div> there is an <em>if/then/else</em> statement.
    </p>

    <p> There is one more nesting level. ... <div style="color: blue;
    background-color: LightYellow">[DOWN] #15/0/1 ⟶ #/15/0/2</div>
    </p>

    <p>... the <em>then</em> and <em>else</em> parts of
    the <em>if</em>. Here, we have more than one item at
    the <em>same</em> nesting level. Even though the two blocks are at
    the
    <em>same</em> nesting level, the two blocks are <em>distinct</em>
    and separate. In some programming languages like Java and
    JavaScript, variables declared in each block would be in
    different <em>scopes</em>.</p>

    <p>
      What we want to do to make parsing <em>easier</em>, is detect this
      nesting level, or more precisely, the <em>scope</em>. And mark
      scope boundaries inside the instruction
      sequence.

    <p>That brings us to these orange comments. These capture what I
      just said. But I’m doing this in the source text rather than in
      the bytecode-instruction sequence. We mark both the beginning
      and the end of the regions.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to get to any code with the same block scope as one of
      the orange instructions which has the word "dominator", you have
      to pass through the "dominator" comment. Similarly, in order get
      to any instruction that <em>follows</em> the scope you have to
      pass through the matching comment that says "join".
    </p>

    <p>So now, let’s look at how the Python interpreter
    sees things...

    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
    LightYellow">#/15/2</div>
    <p>This the way the Python <em>interpreter</em> sees the control
    flow for the bytecode instructions for that Python text.</p>

    <p>This graph comes from the Python <em>control_flow</em> project.
    I created this project to perform more accurate and faster
    decompilation of Python control-flow structures. However, this
    project can be used for other kinds of Python bytecode
    <em>control-flow</em> analysis.</p>

    <p>First, instructions are broken into "Basic Blocks". A "Basic
      Block" a is sequential and non-branching sequence of
      instructions that have no jumps into the code block other than
      to first instruction. Only the last instruction can be a
      conditional or unconditional jump.</p>

    <p>For each basic block that you see in the graph, some
      information about the group of instructions is gathered and is
      summarized as text in the box. The blocks are then assembled
      into this flow chart-like graph.  The compiler term for this is
      a <em>control-flow graph</em>.
      </p>

    <p>Also, we gather information about the edges or arrows that you
      see here in colors.  Let me go over what the colors and arrow
      line style mean....</p>
    <p>Red is the first sibling of a set of alternatives. These come
      about <em>not</em> by an explicit jump instruction, but by
      falling through when <em>not</em> jumping in a conditional jump
      instruction. Fall-through "jumps" are shown in dashed lines.  We
      have two in red and one in brown.</p>

    <p>
      While a red arrow goes the first following block, a blue arrow
      goes to the second following block. Here, this always happens in
      a conditional jump instruction. Conditional jumps are shown as
      dotted lines. So all of the blue lines are also dotted.  Solid
      lines are <em>unconditional</em> jumps.  We have one solid green
      line for the looping jump, and one solid brown line at the
      bottom where the end of the <em>then</em> part jumps around
      the <em>else</em> part to the end of the <em>if/then/else</em>
      construct.
    </p>

    <p>Brown lines show where two control flow paths meet. In the
    Python slide, we called this a "join" point; the compiler term for
    this is a "post-dominator" point.</p>

  <h1>Dominator Regions and Dominators</h1>

    <p>
      Here, we have the control-flow graph from before, but now
      altered to show dominators regions and dominators. This
      graph comes out of a later phase of the "control-flow"
      project.
    </p>
    <p>There is a lot going on here, so let me break this down....
      Let me first define "dominator region" and "dominator".
    </p>

    <p>
      The easiest term to explain is "Dominator Region". This is just
      another term for "scope" described in the last slide.  But it is
      a property that is <em>computed</em> on a directed graph, or
      more precisely a control-flow graph like this. This property is
      used quite a bit in the compiler data-flow analysis. See books
      on advanced compiler optimization for algorithms on how to
      compute this.
    </p>

    <p>What does the <em>"dominator"</em> part of "dominator region"
      mean? A dominator block is a block that you <em>have</em> to
      pass through from the start of the program to get to anything
      underneath it. It acts as a gatekeeper. In other words, the
      instruction or block <em>dominates</em> other instructions or
      blocks underneath it. For example, to get to any instruction in
      the "count bits" program, you have to go through "Basic Block 1"
      which contains the first instruction of the program. That has
      the 3D box shape to indicate the block’s special role as a
      dominator block. Technically, a block dominates itself. When
      that is <em>all</em> it dominates, we don’t show the block in
      3D. Only if it dominates <em>another</em> block do we decorate
      the block in 3D. A similar thing happens for a block getting a
      new color.</p>

    <p>To run an instruction in either Block 4 or Block 5 in brown,
      you have to pass through the <em>all</em> instructions in the
      Block 3. 3D Block 3 then "dominates" Blocks 3, 4, and 5.
      But Block 3 is dominated <em>by</em> both lighter-colored 3D
      Blocks 2 and 1.  The hierarchy of Dominator Blocks is capturing
      the nesting level in the "count bits" program. Notice that
      Blocks 3, 4, and 5 all have the same shade of brown. This means
      they are all part of the same "dominator region", and have
      scopes under the scope of Dominator Block 3.
    </p>

    <p>But notice Block 7 is a lighter tan color, the same color as
      Block 2, Therefore, you don’t <em>have</em> to go through
      darker-color Block 3 to get to Block 7.  Although
      is <em>possible</em> by looping around to get there, that
      doesn’t have to happen. In contrast, to get to Block 7
      you <em>must</em> go through the parent Dominator Block for that
      region, Block 2.
    </p>

    <p>The darker the color a block is, the more nested it is inside
      the other Block regions it is. So block 3 is nested or dominated
      inside block regions 2 and 1.
    </p>

    <p>The upside-down house shape shows a join point, which is the
      other end of a dominator region. It is where a scope ends.
    </p>

    <p>I wave my hands wildly here. There are a <em>lot</em> more
    details to cover, especially in the practical setting of a
    decompiler. But I hope you can see how a program can capture block
    nesting versus alternation and the instruction level. Those whacky
    pseudo tokens inserted into the token stream in the "chained
    comparison" example, are there to convey this nesting and
    sequencing information in a token stream format so that parser can
    understand and match blocks of code. I have an unpublished
    technical paper that explains this in more
    detail.  <div style="color: blue; background-color:
