    <p>In the last slide I described similarities and differences with
      other Python decompilers. However in that I left out Python
      decompilers that use Machine Learning.
    </p>

    <p>Basically, I think there could a ML decompiler could be modeled
    along the approach used here. However the hand-crafted grammar,
    the language would be replaced with machine-learning's approach
    for modelling human language.

    <p>Consider image recognition. The machine learning component is
      not done on raw pixels but instead the first step here is
      "feature extraction".</p>

    <p>In this picture we see groups of pixels grouped into green
    things coming down the right side, and orange things coming down
    the left side on a surface in purple. On the top left and right
    are brown things.

      Here, there was a breakout done before machine learning begins
      to separate people in green and cars in orange, even though they
      both are on the street and use the same amount of pixel real
      estate in the picture. Basically, people aren’t cars.
    </p>

    You can think of the people, cars, street, and buildings as the
    "tokenization" that is done before Machine Lerning would take
    place.  [NEXT] #18/0/1 ⟶ #19
