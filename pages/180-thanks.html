    <p>Now we get to my favorite part!</p>

    <p>It was John Aycott who first had the idea for using a
      grammar-based approach for a toy Python decompiler.  Hartmut
      Goebels wrote the first version that covered a full version of
      Python. In fact, it handed several Python releases from Python
      1.5 to about Python 2.3. <div style="color: blue;

    </p>

    <p>I would like to thank the organizers and program-selection
      committee for inviting me to give this talk, and then making
      sure that things went smoothly after it was accepted.
    </p>

    <p>I have many projects that are in need of attention. So I have
      to figure out which ones to work on. Therefore, when a talk like
      this is accepted, it is encouraging. It shows support for
      projects that I have volunteered a lot my time on, and have
      worked hard on for many years.</p>

    <p>
      In preparation for this talk, I go over the software that I will
      be talking about add new features and remove
      bugs. <div style="color: blue; background-color:
      LightYellow">[DOWN] #/18/1 ⟶ #/18/2</div></p>

    <p>I would like to thank Phil Young for coaching me on this talk. I
      spend a much more time writing code, than I do speaking about the
      code I've written. Phil has been invaluable. He has had many
      great ideas for organizing and presenting this in a more lively,
      and audience-friendly way.</p>

    <p>Also, I thank Lidia Giuliano for organizing and running the
      speaker-coaching program. <div style="color: blue;
      background-color: LightYellow">[DOWN] #/18/2 ⟶ #/18/3</div>
    </p>

    <p>Stuart Frankel edited the talk, and turned some of this into
    English.</p>

    <p>Finally, that you all for listening to me talk about this
    subject. I hope you all will use this information to produce great
    things in the future. <div style="color: blue; background-color:
    LightYellow">[NEXT] #/18/4 ⟶ #/19</div>
