      In this Python expression, we are checking that a variable is

      The bytecode generated for this simple expression is too complex

    <p>
      Let me show how this is parsed. But before I do, we can already
      guess from what we have seen before, that all of the "LOAD_STR"
      instructions will be parsed as "expressions".
    <p>
      Also, keep in mind that parsing is matched just on the blue
      tokens, not any of the other stuff you see shown.
    </p>

    <p> With this, here is a parse of this code... [DOWN]</p>

    <p>
      Here, we see a lot of new tokens from new instructions that we haven't
      seen before. Let me talk a little about some of these. [DOWN]</p>

    <p>
      "DUP_TOP" and "ROT_THREE" are instructions that do not have
      operands; they change Python's evaluation stack. "DUP_TOP"
      duplicates the top item of the stack. "ROT_THREE" reorders the
      top three elements of the stack.
      </p>

    <p>
      The decompilers, and in particular the parser, do not have have
      any deep knowledge of what "DUP_TOP" or "ROT_THREE" do. We just
      know that you can find this in Python 3.8 bytecode as part of
      this kind of chained comparison expression.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is another a new kind of token, I'd like to draw your
      attention to ... [DOWN]
    </p>

    <p>
      "COME_FROM" is not a Python bytecode operation. It was added by
      the tokenizer, and it indicates that a jump instruction jumps
      here. For example "COME_FROM 10", indicates that the instruction
      at offset 10 jumps the real instruction below this one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the instruction.[DOWN]
    </p>

    <p>
      So that explains the funny offset of "18_0":
      the underscore zero indicates that these are pseudo instructions
      that needed to get inserted between two real instructions with
      real offsets.  [NEXT]
